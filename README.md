# Vehicle Analysis Project

**Introduction:**

The Vehicle Analysis Project aims to explore the impact of different factors, including fuel types, drives, and vehicle types, on critical aspects such as miles per gallon, CO2 consumption, and savings. Utilizing data from the continuous dataset provided by Kaggle, this analysis delves into the nuances of vehicle performance and efficiency.

## Data Source ##
• Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/epa/fuel-economy

## Research Question and Hypotheses ##

**Research Question:**
Does switching fuel types, drives, and vehicle types significantly impact the following factors?

• Miles per gallon (MPG)

• CO2 consumption

• Save or spend over 5 years

• Electricity consumption (specifically for electric vehicles)

**Hypotheses:**

**1. Null Hypothesis 1 (H0):**
Switching fuel types has no effect on city & highway MPG.

**Alternate Hypothesis 1 (Ha):**
Switching fuel types does influence city & highway MPG.

**2. Null Hypothesis 2 (H0):**
Switching vehicle drives has no effect on 5-year savings.

**Alternate Hypothesis 2 (Ha):**
Switching vehicle drives does influence 5-year savings.

**3. Null Hypothesis 3 (H0):**
Switching fuel types has no effect on tailpipe CO2 levels.

**Alternate Hypothesis 3 (Ha):**
Switching fuel types does influence tailpipe CO2 levels.

**4. Null Hypothesis 4 (H0):**
Switching terrain has no effect on electricity consumption.

**Alternate Hypothesis 4 (Ha):**
Switching terrain does have an effect on electricity consumption.

## Analysis Sections ##

#### 1. EPA Fuel Economy Data ####

This sheet provides detailed information on vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specifications. Explore columns such as CO2 levels, city, and highway MPG specs, as well as specifications for 4WD, AWD, FWD, and RWD vehicles.

#### 2. City & Highway MPG Comparison ####

Conduct t-tests comparing Diesel and Regular gasoline on City and Highway MPG. Visualize the results with column charts featuring candlesticks for enhanced understanding. Identify the most cost-effective diesel cars through insightful column charts.

#### 3. CO2 Consumption Analysis ####

Compare Regular and Premium gasoline on tailpipe CO2 consumption using t-tests. Visualize the results for a clearer understanding of the differences. Discover the best regular fuel cars with minimal CO2 consumption through detailed column charts.

#### 4. Front & Rear-Wheel Drive Comparison ####

Perform t-tests between Front-Wheel and Rear-Wheel drive vehicles to analyze 5 years save-or-spend data. Visualize the results with comprehensive column graphs and identify top savings by FWD car manufacturers.

#### 5. Tesla Electric Car Analysis ####

Conduct t-tests for Tesla electric cars' highway and city consumption. Visualize the results and identify Tesla as the leading electric car manufacturer for savings. Explore top savings by Tesla models using insightful bar charts.

## Conclusion ##

**Conclusion 1:**
There is a significant difference between city and highway miles per gallon (mpg) concerning different fuel types. The null hypothesis, stating no difference, is rejected.

**Conclusion 2:**
A significant difference exists between spending and saving based on different vehicle drives. The null hypothesis, suggesting no difference, is rejected.

**Conclusion 3:**
Significant differences are observed in tailpipe CO2 levels across different fuel types. The null hypothesis, indicating no difference, is rejected.

**Conclusion 4:**
There is a significant difference in electricity consumption related to different terrains. The null hypothesis, assuming no difference, is rejected.
