## Imformative and easy to read descriptive & inferential statistics Excel visualizations with a PowerPoint presentation.


Using descriptive & inferential statistics, along with Excel visualizations. I was able to show how vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specs affect fuel economy and annual fuel costs.
Using Excel pivot tables, pivot charts, and independent sampling t- test. I created an in-depth power point presentation.

There are 5 worksheets in this workbook, bellow I will describe the importance of what each sheet does.


1. Epa Fuel Economy - Data of vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specs. Some in depth column examples on this sheet would be CO2 levels and consumption.
  City and highway MPG specs. And even specs for 4WD, AWD, FWD, and RWD vehicles.

2. City & Highway mpg- This sheet has sample t-testing between Diesel and Regular gasoline on City and Highway MPG. Along with the t-test you will see on the right side of the sheet
   I have column charts with candle sticks to visualize my testing for a more digestible understanding between Diesel and City gasoline miles per gallon.
   As well, I have a save or spend by diesel fuel car manufactures column chart. Which helps show which diesel car is the most bang for your buck!

3. CO2 Consumption - This sheet has sample t-testing between Regular and Premium gasoline on tailpipe CO2 consumption. Same with sheet #2, on the right hand side of this sheet.
   I have column charts with candle sticks to visualize my testing for a more digestible understanding between Regular and Premium gasoline CO2 levels. And, a seperate column chart
   that shows the best regular fuel cars that have the least ammount of CO2 cosumption.

4. Front & Rear wheel - This sheet has sample t-testing between Front-Wheel & Rear-Wheel drive vehicles on 5 years save or spend. I have two column graphs one to help
   visualize my t-test. Then, the second column chart to show the top savings by FWD car manufactures.

5. Tesla - Last sheet was to do some t-testing for electric car buyers! I did a t-test for tesla on highway and city consumption. As well, I made two column charts one to show a visualized understanding
   to my t-test. The second column chart to show that Tesla is the best saving electric car manufacture in the industry. And, I included a bar chart to show the top savings by Tesla models.


Using the t -test method, I was able to use my confidence interval levels to prove whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis with confidence.

ALONG with the Excel workbook, I have the PowerPoint attached. Which has been presented to the companies business team.
